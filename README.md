# Udacity session lead automation

## What is this ?

As a [Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree session lead](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0044), I felt the need to automate a few tasks to gain more efficiency and focus more on the great experience that is teaching and learning with other students !
Automations currently enabled are:

- sending emails in bulk to students who are behing on their Nanodegree program
